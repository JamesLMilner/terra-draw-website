# Terra Draw Website

The official [Terra Draw](https://www.github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw) website repository.

# Running Locally

You can then create a watching build that allows you to test out both changes in the example but also the Terra Draw source itself, like so:

`npm run dev`

This will start a hot reloading development server on port 8080 that you can explore via [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080).

HTTPS is required for the geolocation button to work. You may see some warnings when developing locally in your browser but these can be skipped. If you wish to develop locally over http without the warnings you can run `npm run dev:http` instead. Please be aware using the geolocate button will not work in this instance.
